# MongoDB $inc Operator Unexpected Behavior with Nested Arrays

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB to update elements within nested arrays.  The incorrect usage can lead to unexpected results or incorrect data updates.  The solution provided corrects the error and explains why the original approach is flawed.

## Bug Description

The initial code attempts to increment a counter within a nested array using the `$inc` operator and the positional operator (`$[]`). However, this approach doesn't work as expected because it doesn't correctly identify the specific element to increment.   This usually stems from a misunderstanding of how the positional operator interacts with array updates.

## Solution

The solution uses a more robust approach, employing the `$` operator with an array filter to identify the correct element to update before incrementing it.  This ensures the correct element is targeted for the `$inc` operation.
